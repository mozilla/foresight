# Inclusive Creation

Inclusive creation means involving people and communities of all facets throughout the creation process. This includes providing opportunities for people of varying demographics, abilities, and web literacy to participate as researchers, designers, creators, and users. 

As Mozilla remains committed to an internet that promotes civil discourse, human dignity, and individual expression, to include all people of the earth, and it is committed to include people and communities beyond the average throughout its creative processes. Through creating programs and initiatives throughout the entire Mozilla organization, we can offer people a diversity of ways to participate, whether that’s through providing more opportunities to who can shape, research, and create future technologies or putting users first to ensure that everyone can access the web of the future. 

By prioritizing diversity and inclusion centrally in Mozilla programs and initiatives, we can ensure that a web that is open and accessible for everyone, also includes the opportunity to participate in research, and to generate future technologies that make products most impactful, innovative and valuable to diverse audiences.

## Research Questions
1. How can Mozilla incorporate inclusive design at all levels of the product development life cycle? 
2. How can Mozilla support inclusion (and exclusion) expertise in understanding user needs? 
3. How can organizations, including Mozilla, demonstrate the product and revenue value of integrating inclusion into their processes?
