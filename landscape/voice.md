# Voice

In a future where hands-free and screen-free interactions dominate how humans communicate with computers, it is imperative that Mozilla deeply understands how to leverage this interaction modality to retain table stakes in the Internet of the future. Insofar that we can present a privacy-preserving alternative to how machine learning algorithms are trained whilst still offering users value, we can secondarily impact and shift the operating model that current big players are using to develop AI (i.e. with perverse incentives regarding users’ data). Moreover, through taking an inclusive and values-sensitive approach to how AI is developed for the screen-free world, Mozilla can lead the way in creating AI that will augment all lives, and not broaden the digital divide.

In a hands-free future where voice becomes a primary mode of interaction, Mozilla has the opportunity to ensure that a voice-enabled Internet grows in an open and decentralized way, and freely allows consumers and developers to participate in this innovation frontier. Through the development of relevant voice-based technologies, Mozilla sees the long-term possibility of continuing to offer its users more choice and agency in how they interact with the web and broaden voice’s reach in the current market.

## Research Questions
1. How can we support users’ information seeking and engagement behaviors on the web via voice? 
2. How might we continue to support an open and innovative web culture while corporations amass voice data for themselves?        
3. How can we protect users’ sensitive voice data throughout the full lifecycle of a voice-based technology?

## Signals of the Future
* XR Privacy Co-Design Workshop <br>
Two session workshop in which participants created scenarios to uncover the privacy implications of smart homes and co-designed corresponding controls. Six factors emerged from participants’ designs: data transparency and control, security, safety, usability and UX, system intelligence, and system modality.
